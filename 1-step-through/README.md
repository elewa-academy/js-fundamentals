## Learning Objectives

__Study Techniques:__
* Stepping through run-time behavior
* Tracking variables
* Diagramming flow control

__JavaScript:__
* Data types:
  * Primitive vs Objects 
  * Type Conversion
* Variables: var, let, const
  * Assignment by value
  * Assignment by pointer
  * Reassignment
  * Scope - Lexical
  * Scope - Block
* Operators & Comparisons:
  * 2-value operators
  * Order of operations
  * Truthy & Falsey evaluations
* Control Flow:
  * If, else, else if
  * For
  * While, do while
  * Switch/case

__Programming Skillzz:__
* Code life-cycle:
  * Source-time
  * Build-time
  * Run-time
* Stepping through:
  * (Run-time behavior)
  * Predicting flow control
  * Evaluating operations
  * Evaluating comparisons
* Tracking variables:
  * Creation & hoisting (build-time)
  * Assignment & reassignment
  * Chained assignments
  * Shared references

#### Tools:
* [PythonTutor for JavaScript](http://www.pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=edit):
  * For building your Notional Machine: visualizes how the JavaScript engine steps through code, deals with variables, and handles function execution. 
  * Copy your code into the text area and click "visualize execution".  Step through line by line with the "forward" button.  See [this markdown]() for more tips.
* [Step-Through Diagrams](make a folder in this repo):
  * By Step:  Focus on everything that happens in each step of execution. 
  * By Variable:  Focus on how each variable changes over the course of program execution.
* [Parsonizer](https://elewa-academy.github.io/parsons/):
  * Randomizes the lines in your code, you have to put them back in order (tabs count!).  This will help you learn syntactic structures & develop your logical problem solving skills by studying quality examples.
  * Copy paste your code into the text box and click the magic button.  Click "get feedback" to grade your answer.
* [Realtime flow-chart generator](https://bogdan-lyashenko.github.io/js-code-to-svg-flowchart/docs/live-editor/index.html):
  * For visualizing flow control, the logical structure & progression of your code.
  * Copy paste code into this site to automatically generate flow control visualizations.
